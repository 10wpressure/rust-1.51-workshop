# Part 4

To build everything, `cd` into the `part4/` directory and run:

```shell
rustc numbers.rs
```

This will compile your `numbers.rs` file into `numbers` (or `numbers.exe` on Windows).

Then you can run it with `./numbers` (or `numbers.exe` on Windows).

## Exercise

Open `numbers.rs` in your editor and resolve the TODOs there.

After you complete each one, re-run `rustc numbers.rs` to
recompile the `numbers` executable, then re-run the executable to see the output!
