    //
    // Option 1: Pass numbers.clone() some of the time.
    //           (Experiment to see when it's needed!)
    //
    // Option 2: Change some of the functions to return a tuple
    //           of (i64, Vec<i64>), using the `numbers` argument
    //           as the Vec<i64> to return. With this approach,
    //           you won't need to call .clone() at all!
