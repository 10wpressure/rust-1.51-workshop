# Part 3

To build everything, `cd` into the `part3/` directory and run:

```shell
rustc city.rs
```

This will compile your `city.rs` file into `city` (or `city.exe` on Windows).

Then you can run it with `./city` (or `city.exe` on Windows).

## Exercise

Open `city.rs` in your editor and resolve the TODOs there.

After you complete each one, re-run `rustc city.rs` to
recompile the `city` executable, then re-run the executable to see the output!
