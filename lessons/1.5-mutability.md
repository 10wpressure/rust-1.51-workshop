# Mutability

## `let` and initialization

You can declare a `let` value without initializing it, but it must be
initialized before it's used.

[ example, including intialization inside all `if` and `else if` branches ]

However, you do have to initialize it before it gets used.

## `let mut`

Once a `let` value has been initialized, it cannot be reassigned to a different
value. For that, you need `let mut`.

```rust
let x = 5; // x can never be reassigned
let mut y = 6;

y = y + 1;
y += 1; // Syntax sugar for y = y + 1
```

## Shadowing vs. mutating

## `mut` parameters

NOTE: you can in fact use `let` to shadow a parameter instead of mutating it
