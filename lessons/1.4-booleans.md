# Booleans

## The `bool` type

You can cast from `bool` to any of the number types using `as`. 
`true` casts to `1` and `false` casts to `0`.

To convert from a `bool` to a number, use `== 0` with that number.

## The `==` operator

Rust's `==` operator returns `true` if two values are structurally equal,
and `false` if they are not.

```
1 == 2 // returns `false`
```

Rust has no `===` operator, just `==`.

## `if` conditionals

In Rust, `if` requires a `bool` condition and then some code inside a `{` and `}` block.

```
if cats > 1 {
    println!("Multiple cats!");
}
```

Rust does not have "truthiness" - so `if` must always be given a `bool`.

## `else`

You can use the result of an `if` directly as long as the `if` is paired 
with an `else`.

```
let suffix = if same_name_as_parent { 
    "Jr" 
} else { 
    "" 
};
```

Without the `else`, this would not have compiled, because Rust wouldn't know
what to set `suffix` to if `same_name_as_parent` is `false`. (Rust does not
have an equivalent of JavaScript's `null` or `undefined`.)

## `else if`

You can use `else if` like in most languages:

```
let suffix = if same_name_as_parent_and_grandparent { 
    "III" 
} else if same_name_as_parent { 
    "Jr"
} else if same_name_as_child { 
    "Sr" 
} else {
    ""
;
```

You can use `else` and `else if` any time - not just when using the output of 
an `if`.
