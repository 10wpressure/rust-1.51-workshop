# Strings

## Hello, World!

Here's a Rust program which prints "Hello, World!" to the console:

```
fn main() {
    println!("Hello World!");
}
```

If you put this in a file called `app.rs` and compile it by running `rustc app.rs`, it will generate a binary executable called `app` which you can then run to see the output.

## Defining variables with `let`

All variables in Rust are defined using `let`. This program will still print "Hello, World!" to the console:

```
fn main() {
    let greeting = "Hello";
    let subject = "World";

    println!("{}, {}!", greeting, subject);
}
```

This is because `println!` replaces the first `{}` with `greeting` and the second `{}` with `subject`. We can have as many or as few of these as we like.

`println!` is a macro. You can tell a macro apart from a normal function call because macros always end in `!` whereas normal function calls never do. We'll talk more about macros later.

## Crashing with `panic!`

We can intentionally crash a Rust program using the `panic!` macro. 
It supports the same `{}` interpolation syntax that `println!` does.

```
fn main() {
    let crash_reason = "unforeseen circumstances";

    panic!("This program crashed due to {}!", crash_reason);

    println!("This will never get run.");
}
```

Rust does not have `try`/`catch`, so whenever you `panic!` you can really expect the program to crash. (We'll talk about how Rust does error handling and recovery later.)
