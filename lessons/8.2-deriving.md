## Deriving

You can have Rust's compiler generate automatic implementations for certain
traits by annotating your `struct` or `enum` with `deriving` like so:

```rust
#[deriving(Clone, Display, Debug)]
struct Person {
    first_name: String,
    last_name: String,
}
```

This meanss `Person` has automatic implementations for `Clone`, `Display`,
`Debug`
