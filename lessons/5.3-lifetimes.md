# Lifetime Annotations

Lifetime annotations are often needed when *returning* references.

## The `'static` Lifetime


## Lifetime Elision

Lifetime annotations are not needed when there is exactly 1 reference in
the return type and also exactly 1 reference in the arguments. In that case,
Rust knows the only way the function could be valid is if they have the same
lifetime, so it automatically gives them the same lifetime for you.
